# NFL-Draft-Model

### Abstract
-----------
A program that predicts which college football players should have the most success at the professional level. Our project aspires to determine the likelihood of a college-level quarterback to be successful upon being drafted into the NFL. Career stats of over 900 college quarterbacks from 2000 to 2016 were obtained in the form of a .csv file from pro-football-reference.com. This list was narrowed down to only include 87 players who were actually drafted into the NFL and played at least 10 games there.
