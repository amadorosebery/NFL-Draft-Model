# NFL-Draft-Model

### Abstract
-----------
A program that predicts which college football players should have the most success at the professional level. Our project aspires to determine the likelihood of a college-level quarterback to be successful upon being drafted into the NFL. Career stats of over 900 college quarterbacks from 2000 to 2016 were obtained in the form of a .csv file from pro-football-reference.com. This list was narrowed down to only include 87 players who were actually drafted into the NFL and played at least 10 games there.

### Motivation
-----------
The NFL draft is a annual event where professional football teams take turns selecting college football players who will be added to their pro roster. Since the goal of an NFL football team to win as many games as possible, and ultimately win a championship, it makes sense that teams are always trying to draft the best college players possible who will help them win the most games. The problem is that some athletes perform extremely well in college but fail to find the same success at the pro level and vice versa. This is the motivation for our project. We wanted to build a computer program which, through the use of statistical analysis and modeling, would be able to help us predict which players were going to have the biggest impact in the NFL after coming out of college. There are many factors that go into projecting a player's skill at the NFL level, but we wanted to attempt to do so in a non-biased, scientific manner. Choosing the right college player to play for your team is decision that could lead to another year of mediocrity or a decade of success for your team, and for this reason we chose to build a program that can help teams make the most well informed decision possible.
